# Subway-System-Simulation-in-C-
This project is about applying data structure knowledge into creating a subway system, things such as linked list, structures, sorting algorythms, classes etc. Make sure you are compiling with GCC for code to run smoothly as some packages are GCC exclusive. On a side note, although this is a 4 person assignment, coding is all done by myself.
